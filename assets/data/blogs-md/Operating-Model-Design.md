This image presents a framework for thinking about **operating model design holistically**,
emphasizing that decisions related to organizational structure and processes are critical and
directly impact value delivery. It breaks down the operating model into three key pillars:
**Structure, Process, and People**.
  
Let's delve into each pillar in detail:

Overarching Message
-------------------

The central message at the top, "Think about the operating model holistically, as many decisions
related to structure and processes will be critical and link to value delivery," underscores the
interconnectedness of these elements. It suggests that an effective operating model isn't just
about how the organization is set up (structure) or how work gets done (process), but also about
the people who execute that work. All these aspects must be considered together to achieve
desired outcomes and deliver value.

Operating Model Design
----------------------

This is the overarching theme, indicating that the following sections are components that need
to be intentionally designed and aligned.

1. **Pillar: Structure**

   This pillar focuses on how the organization is organized and its fundamental building
   blocks. It includes:

   * **"Boxes and lines" (primary and secondary axes of organization and structure):**
     This refers to the traditional organizational chart, outlining the different
     departments, divisions, and reporting relationships. It defines the formal hierarchy
     and how different parts of the organization are connected. This includes both the
     primary way the organization is segmented (e.g., by product, geography, function)
     and any secondary structures (e.g., matrix structures).
   * **Roles and responsibilities (e.g., profit-and-loss ownership, corporate-function
     role, sales team structure):**
     This defines the specific duties, accountabilities, and authority assigned to
     individuals and teams within the structure. It clarifies who is responsible for
     what, including key aspects like profit and loss ownership and the specific
     organization of functional teams (like sales).
   * **Governance (e.g., decision rights, committee structure):**
     This outlines how decisions are made within the organization. It defines who has the
     authority to make specific decisions, the processes for decision-making, and the
     role of committees and other governing bodies.
   * **Boundaries and location (e.g., global footprint):**
     This considers the physical and geographical scope of the organization. It includes
     decisions about where different parts of the organization are located (globally or
     regionally) and the boundaries between different organizational units or with
     external partners.
   In essence, the "Structure" pillar answers the question: "How is the organization
   formally set up and who is responsible for what, and where?"
2. **Pillar: Process**

   This pillar focuses on how work flows and how tasks are executed within the
   organization. It includes:

   * **Process design (cross-cutting process redesign):** This involves defining,
     documenting, and optimizing the key processes that span across different parts of
     the organization (cross-functional processes). This could include processes like
     order fulfilment, product development, or customer onboarding. Redesigning these
     processes aims for efficiency, effectiveness, and better customer outcomes.
   * **Linkages (formal mechanisms to link corporate functions and business units):**
     This refers to the established and documented ways in which different parts of the
     organization (like corporate functions like HR or Finance and the various business
     units) interact and collaborate. These linkages can be through formal meetings,
     reporting structures, shared systems, or defined workflows.
   * **Performance management (e.g., metrics and targets by which performance is
     measured):** This defines how the organization measures its success and the
     performance of its various parts and individuals. It includes establishing key
     performance indicators (KPIs), setting targets, and tracking progress against those
     targets.
   * **Systems and technology (e.g., end-state architecture):** This encompasses the
     IT systems, tools, and technology infrastructure that support the organization's
     processes. It also considers the desired future state of the technology architecture
     to enable efficient and effective operations.

   In essence, the "Process" pillar answers the question: "How does work actually get done
   across the organization, how do different parts connect, how is performance measured,
   and what technology supports these activities?"
3. **Pillar: People**

   This pillar focuses on the human element of the operating model, recognizing that people
   are crucial for executing the structure and processes. It includes:

   * **Workforce size (e.g., synergies in roles in corporate functions, sales, and
     non-sales):** This considers the number of people needed in different parts of
     the organization to effectively execute the work. It also looks for opportunities to
     create synergies and efficiencies in roles across different functions.
   * **Talent and skills (e.g., retaining and selecting talent, addressing talent
     gaps):** This focuses on having the right people with the necessary skills and
     competencies in the right roles. It includes strategies for attracting, recruiting,
     developing, and retaining talent, as well as identifying and addressing any gaps in
     skills.
   * **Culture (e.g., working norms, values, management practices):** This refers to
     the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and norms that influence how people work
     together within the organization. It also includes management styles and practices
     that shape the employee experience and organizational effectiveness.
   * **Informal networks (e.g., influencers supporting change management):** This
     acknowledges the existence and importance of informal relationships and
     communication channels within the organization. Identifying and leveraging
     influential individuals within these networks can be crucial for driving change and
     adoption of new ways of working.

   In essence, the "People" pillar answers the question: "Who are the people doing the work,
   what are their skills, what is the culture like, and how do formal and informal networks
   influence operations?"

The Holistic View
-----------------

The framework emphasizes that these three pillars are not independent but rather interconnected
and interdependent. Decisions made in one area will inevitably impact the others. For example:

* A change in the **structure** (e.g., creating a new department) will require defining new
  **roles and responsibilities**, potentially impacting existing **processes**, and
  necessitating the hiring or retraining of **people** with specific **skills**.
* Redesigning a key **process** might require changes to the **structure** to ensure the
  right teams are involved, necessitate new **systems and technology**, and demand that
  **people** adopt new **working norms** and develop new **skills**
* A shift in organizational **culture** can influence how effectively **structures** and
  **processes** are implemented and how engaged and productive **people** are.

Therefore, when designing or redesigning an operating model, leaders need to consider all three
pillars in an integrated way to ensure alignment and maximize value delivery. Neglecting any one
pillar can lead to inefficiencies, lack of clarity, and ultimately, hinder the organization's
ability to achieve its goals.
