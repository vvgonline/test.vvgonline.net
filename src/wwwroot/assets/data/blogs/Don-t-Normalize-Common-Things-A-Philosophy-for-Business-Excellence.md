This simple yet profound statement challenges us to question the very foundation of how we operate,
think,
and grow. In a world where conformity often leads to stagnation, embracing the uncommon can be the
key to
unlocking true innovation and excellence.

What Does It Mean?
------------------

When something becomes "common," it's easy to accept it as the default—the way things should be. But common
doesn't mean correct. Common doesn't mean optimal. And common certainly doesn't mean it can't be improved.

### Why This Matters?

The businesses that transform industries aren't the ones that accept common practices—they're the ones that
challenge them. Netflix didn't normalize video rental stores. Tesla didn't normalize traditional automotive
manufacturing. Amazon didn't normalize conventional retail.

They questioned what everyone else accepted. They saw opportunities where others saw obstacles. They dared
to be different, and in doing so, they redefined excellence in their fields.

### The VVG ONLINE Approach

At VVG ONLINE, we don't help businesses do common things better. We help them question whether those common
things should exist at all.

Digital transformation isn't about digitizing old processes—it's about re-imagining what's possible when you
refuse to normalize what's merely common.

### Your Challenge

This week, identify one "common" practice in your business:   
- Ask: "Why do we do it this way?"   
- Challenge: "Is there a better way?"   
- Innovate: "What would this look like if we started from scratch?"

### Final Thought
